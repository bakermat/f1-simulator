# Splunk Observability Cloud

In order to send metrics to Splunk Observability Cloud you will need access to an Organization. A free trial is available [here](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/o11y-cloud-free-trial.html). Ensure you select the same region as the one you are using for the F1 Simulator.

Once you are successfully logged into Splunk Observability Cloud, you will need to obtain an Access Token with the `ingest` capability. This can be done by following the instructions [here](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/admin/authentication-tokens/org-tokens.html#ingest-tokens).
