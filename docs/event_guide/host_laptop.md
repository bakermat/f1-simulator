1. Laptop must be a Windows based PC with an ethernet connection and a wifi connection.
    1. 1 ethernet connection with outside internet connectivity will suffice too
    2. Laptop must be on the same network as sim rigs **AND** have external network access.
2. Download the Compiled Scripts [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11raL5RvPJUDjtey9yV4OFdNqnJgJxAlm) to your laptop.
3. Unzip the scripts to your laptop
4. Double click on the corresponding sim rigs you have. E.g. - sim\_rig\_1, sim\_rig\_2, etc.
5. Type in the name of the racer, and you're ready to seat them in the rig.
    1. The script will automatically request a new name and update when a new racer is entered
    2. There is no need to restart the script for a new racer, just enter the new name and you're good to go.
